### kelvin
```terminal password manager```

### about
kelvin is a password manager like 1password but for the terminal. kelvin generates strong passwords from the terminal to your clipboard. generated passwords could be encrypted and saved with the domain names or what they correspond to, locally. all encrypted passwords are saved locally for later decryption by the authorized user. kelvin saves the data locally and encrypts the hidden directory with the gnu gpg.
<p>
    in future kelvin is to be a terminal app with tui, daemonized so it could be started with a keybinding when user wants to get their password or add a password to the vault.
